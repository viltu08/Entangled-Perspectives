                        <p><strong>How do you balance the complexity of the narrative at hand with the abstraction to
                                create
                                emotional or experiential impact on the viewer?</strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            "The balance comes with the assignment in hand. How it usually works -at least for me- is
                            like a
                            Venn diagram between what I think it works and I like based on my life experience, what the
                            client
                            needs and what the brief demands. The sweet spot between this 3 areas is where you find the
                            balance
                            to create -hopefully- an emotional response. Abstraction in graphic design is tied strongly
                            to a
                            problem to be solved, so balance for me is to find an uncommon solution inside the universe
                            of a
                            client's needs, the brief in hand and the context the brand is living in. Personally,
                            emotional
                            response comes from your unique vision as an artist/designer to the problem in hand, so at
                            the end,
                            my Venn diagram is unique in comparison to the Venn diagram of other person."

            <summary>Difference between “complex” and “complicated”</summary>
            <div class="nested-content">
                <p>I used the words ‘complex’ and ‘complicated’ interchangeably, but that changed when I started
                    looking at the projects I have done and writing about what parts I find complicated and what I find
                    complex in the project.
                    <br><br>
                    I realised it was a complicated process when I started learning to use HTML and CSS for Web design
                    in 2024. There are multiple rules and syntaxes to learn. But, once you get used to those, you can
                    apply similar methods to create various effects. The process started becoming uncomplicated by
                    sequencing the code neatly and logically.
                    <br><br>
                    While the languages used to build a website are complicated, designing an interactive website about
                    <a href="https://viltu08.github.io/Monsoon-Memories/" class="pulsating-link" target="_blank">Monsoon
                        Memories</a> is complex. I could create a controlled layout and apply all the CSS rules for
                    perfect animations, but the complexity arises from user interaction. I could not predict which
                    window someone would interact with first or if they would prefer poems to be more like the
                    typographic playgrounds of existing poems. One interaction leads to another and creates a domino
                    effect of unexpected experiences, which varies from individual to individual.
                    <br><br>
                    So, developing a fully functional, beautiful site is a complicated experience for me, but adapting
                    and iterating the same site based on user experience is a complex process.
                    <br><br>
                    Something complicated seems resolvable once I follow a given set of rules or logic. Still, a complex
                    system requires constant work and responsiveness, as all its elements behave symbiotically and
                    continuously alter how we experience them.
                    <br><br>
                    A complex system like <a href="https://viltu08.github.io/Monsoon-Memories/" class="pulsating-link"
                        target="_blank">Monsoon Memories</a> exists within a Web of influences. I observed that people
                    don’t just interact with the site; they bring their memories, contexts, and moods into the
                    experience. This mutuality means the site isn’t just a fixed-designed object—it’s a living,
                    breathing and altering system shaped by the user and the maker. The website has changed
                    exponentially since its conception because of these observations.
                    <br><br>
                    When people share what they find engaging or confusing on the site, it creates a loop where their
                    actions influence my design choices, and my design choices reshape their experience, which calls for
                    continuous adaptation in design.
                    <br><br>
                    By putting in enough time and effort, I can achieve some form of predictability for a complicated
                    design, but a complex design keeps changing, almost like a living organism.
                    <br><br>
                    In that sense, Crafting Complexity isn’t about finding solutions for complex problems but designing
                    spaces focusing on interactions and being flexible for evolution of those ideas.

                            "Okay, so, I think complexity is natural, the world is complex, but the function of design
                            is to make the complex less complicated. There's this discussion about simplicity and
                            complexity and the conclusions that I reached are that design should allow, or should build
                            a simple bridge to complexity because we shouldn't simplify reality, but we need to make
                            information accessible. I'm seeing it as a process, we have to allow simple bridges or
                            pathways towards a more complex understanding of things in general."

            <summary>Shifting Perspectives, Complexity as a Spectrum</summary>
            <div class="nested-content">
                <p>Looking at stars at night brings me joy and boosts my curiosity. At first glance, they are simple
                    twinkling dots of light—small, distant, and seemingly straightforward. But if we shift our
                    perspective and look through a telescope, those dots transform. Suddenly, we start seeing colours,
                    textures, and variations. They’re no longer just glowing points in the sky. With advanced
                    telescopes, we can determine the elements they’re made of, the time of their birth and death, the
                    radiations they emit, and intricate structural details. This shift in perspective adds layers to our
                    understanding, providing more context to visualise those stars in their surrounding environment—a
                    cosmos filled with galaxies, nebulas, and worlds unseen.</p>

                <p>Here, complexity becomes a choice, not a necessity. It’s something we can dial up or down, depending
                    on the narrative we wish to create. This is an objective view of complexity—one rooted in data and
                    observation. But what happens when the perspective shifts to something more subjective? What if I
                    start describing the emotions I feel when I look at those stars? Does that change how the stars
                    exist? It doesn’t. Instead, it opens up a new layer—a possibility of what the stars could mean to
                    different sentient beings.</p>

                    In my book design project, <a href="https://vishakharuhela.com/Conscious-Cosmos" target="_blank"
                        class="pulsating-link">Conscious Cosmos</a>, I explore how I can transfer the control over
                    complexity to the reader. The primary text from Robert Lanza’s Biocentrism offers a revolutionary
                    view of the universe by asking us to view it from a lens of consciousness and biology, in addition
                    to physics, chemistry and mathematics. He uses a mix of storytelling and facts to make the theories
                    accessible to the reader. The secondary text, generated using ChatGPT (artificial consciousness)
                    evolves into orbiting electrons—haikus, songs, and metaphors—that eventually dominate the pages. The
                    modular nature of this layout allows the reader to toggle between different levels of complexity.
                    Much like exploring the stardust using a telescope, the reader decides how immersed they would like
                    to be in the content.
                </p>

                <p>When I approach a project, I dive deeply into research. You could say I always have a telescopic
                    approach to exploring a new topic. I don’t always know what the final outcome will look like. Will I
                    end up creating a complex website to share the narrative, or will I simplify everything into a
                    single poster that symbolizes the idea? It’s during the process of designing that I make
                    choices—revealing and layering the information I’ve gathered.</p>

                <p>Complexity feels inherent to the way I work, think, and write. My brain energizes like a
                    multiverse-traveling spaceship, imagining hundreds of ways to approach a single topic. Sometimes I
                    choose structure to create clarity and accessibility. For instance, in my project <a

                        Measure of Victory</a>, I create ten plates using a data visualization approach to dissect
                    everything I know about the Trajan Column. Here, complexity lies in the layered narrative, ranging
                    from the material composition to the history and emotions tied to its existence. Yet, the final
                    output is modular—simple, interconnected modules that form a richer story when viewed together.</p>

                <p>In contrast, when I want to express the <a href="https://vishakharuhela.com/Visual-Tactility"
                        target="_blank" class="pulsating-link">Visual Tactility</a> of the Trajan Column, I design a
                    video-motion project. Using microscopes, I record textures and project them onto paper sculptures
                    inspired by natural patterns. This transforms my microscopic observations into an immersive,
                    macroscopic experience. Here, complexity emerges through layered interpretations, visual metaphors,
                    and maximalist renderings that blend sound and sight. The plates serve as a direct visualisation of
                    the research, while the motion graphics open a space for interpretation and emotional connection.

            <summary>Fact and Fiction—Complexity as a mix of reality and imagination</summary>
            <div class="nested-content">
                <p>A combination of real and imaginary numbers, complex numbers make rendered motion possible in digital
                    design.</p>

                <p>z = a + bi</p>

                <p>z = complex number<br>
                    a = real number | in design, grid<br>
                    b = real number | in design, modules<br>
                    i = imaginary number | abstraction</p>

                <p>Here, complexity is achieved by mixing reality and imagination. For such a perspective, the reality
                    consists of physically tactile entities, and the imagination provokes visual tactility. The only way
                    to achieve complete understanding is to embrace such complexity in the way we think. It’s the same
                    way a poet/poetess creates fantastical worlds for us, which otherwise wouldn’t be possible to
                    imagine. In a way, the concept of complexity as a mix of reality and imagination is equivalent to
                    creating immersive experiences that mix real physical entities with imaginary ideas.</p>

                <p>I explore this concept through the project, <a href="https://viltu08.github.io/Quantum-Type-Lab/"
                        class="pulsating-link" target="_blank">Quantum Type Lab</a>, a digital gallery for experimental
                    typography where I
                    overlap design and scientific principles, exploring intersections of atomic structures and the
                    transformative potential of variable typefaces. This project treats typography as a mutable
                    entity—one that, like atoms, can exist in different states: ground, excited, or ionized. Typography
                    here is not static; it mutates, transforming from one form to another and embodying the fluidity of
                    both waves and particles as in quantum theory.</p>

                <p>As with complex numbers, the combination of real and imaginary elements within the typography system
                    brings forth new forms and interactive possibilities. It is a space where typography is both real
                    (rooted in physical design of glyphs, grids, and modules) and imaginary (expanding into abstract
                    forms based on imagined quantum behavior of typography). The pulsating portals allow you to travel
                    between glyphs, and the particle-based punctuations energize on hovering. This immersive experience
                    allows users to engage with typography that abstracts scientific principles through interactive
                    visualizations.</p>

                                <p><strong>I came across your mention of the Norm Studio in FVS book and I ended up on
                                        their
                                        website and saw their Numerical Designs with the diagrammatic representation of
                                        motion, which led me to write about complex numbers. I'm a big fan of metaphors,
                                        so
                                        I use complex numbers as a metaphor because it's a mix of real numbers and
                                        imaginary
                                        numbers to get a better understanding. In design, I see grids and modules as

                                        and the abstraction we achieve out of them as the imagination part. I wonder, do

                                        think such mathematical and scientific concepts can support an argument for the

                                    "Yeah, for sure. But I think one of the difficulties that we are facing at the
                                    moment
                                    is that we do not have one language anymore to understand reality or we understood
                                    that reality can't be understood just through one perspective, and that we need to
                                    somehow establish frameworks that allow us to access reality through different
                                    perspectives. We have to live with multi-perspective visions of reality. But I think
                                    it should be clear that it is one of the perspectives and that we need different
                                    contrasting languages. There's an interesting small table in the beginning of the
                                    book by Jacques Batin about the kind of information that can be accessed through
                                    what kind of visual language and he's talking about abstract and concrete language
                                    as well. We can access more metaphorical or meta understandings of reality through
                                    something very abstract. But then we need as well a more specific and concrete
                                    representation of reality through numbers and statistics. I find this interesting
                                    that we do not have to choose one or the other, but we should use them together to
                                    get a multi-perspective view on reality or whatever we are trying to display or

                            <br>
                            "I think that one of the most important aspects of my work on <a
                                href="https://amirahanafi.com//tagged/qat" target="_blank" class="pulsating-link">A

                            was that it was long and sustained. I thought of the project idea while I was participating
                            in the first weeks of the uprising in Egypt in 2011. I didn't start to work on the project
                            until 2014, so I had already had three years to live in the context of the revolution and
                            think about how language was functioning in that space. I think that without this lived
                            experience it would have been really impossible for me to organize the project in the way
                            that I did.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I'm not sure what you have in mind when you say "rigid format" because there were actually
                            several systems of organization that I used within the project. One was the vocabulary box
                            which was organized into four categories. Another was the way that I found interlocutors for
                            the project, by assembling a team of interviewers and using a snowball interviewing method.
                            Once I had recorded hundreds of hours of conversation, I used another system to listen to
                            the recordings and create an audio archive. In each recording, a person would speak about
                            multiple terms drawn from the vocabulary box. Rather than listen to one person's recording
                            at a time, I would listen to all of the recordings for a single term, which meant I was
                            cycling through different voices every day. This heightened the sense of complexity of
                            meaning and informed the final design of the work, which is circular and non-linear.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The digital publication and the diagrams were the final organizing aspect of the project.
                            They came after I had already composed texts for each of the 125 terms in the book. I
                            decided how to organize this material for an online reader at a point where I had a very
                            deep understanding of the material I had worked with. I had developed a very intimate
                            relationship to the people and the voices in the project, which informed how I wrote the
                            texts. One of the researchers I had worked with, Ahmed Refaat, had suggested to me early in
                            the project that we might organize the terms into families. This is how I came to decide on
                            the relational aspect of the digital work. I wanted to answer the question, "What do people
                            speak about when they speak about 'x' term?" I worked with a programmer, Youssef Faltas, who
                            presented me with some options for how we might visually represent the relationships I
                            wanted to establish.

                                class="pulsating-link">CreaTures Glossary</a> approaches meaning-making in a different
                            way, but it's actually
                            closely tied to the work I did on <a href="https://amirahanafi.com//tagged/qat"
                                target="_blank" class="pulsating-link">A Dictionary of the Revolution</a>. You can see
                            from how I
                            described my work on A Dictionary that it was multi-modal and was engaged with language as a
                            social practice. For <a href="https://amirahanafi.com//tagged/glossary" target="_blank"
                                class="pulsating-link">CreaTures Glossary</a>, I wanted to focus more on the fluid,
                            relational
                            aspect of language and meaning-making that I explored in the research phase of <a

                                class="pulsating-link">CreaTures Glossary</a> does this in a digital
                            space as opposed to the live conversations that I held for the research in Egypt. <a
                                href="https://amirahanafi.com//tagged/glossary" target="_blank"
                                class="pulsating-link">CreaTures Glossary</a> was also very experimental. I built a
                            number of different components that work
                            together, but now I am working on each of those components separately to really investigate
                            their potential. Conceptually, I am interested in building digital tools that facilitate
                            meaning-making in relation to the people that are using them.

                        <p><strong>How would you imagine a flexible visual system catering to multiple languages for an
                                identity? How could we achieve that variation while still keeping a constant or cohesive
                                aesthetic? If there is a system which is catering to a group of people who are
                                bilingual, for example, and we use language within the system. It might be Hindi and
                                English and they might have very different aesthetic, how languages and the glyphs look.
                                So how would we work in a system where multiple languages are there and still have a
                                cohesive aesthetic going on?</strong>

                            "That's another very interesting question. I was thinking a lot about this because, in the
                            digital world, it becomes easier and easier to be responsive to users using their
                            identities. I'm not sure if this is the right way to go, because otherwise, we are again in
                            this affirmative algorithms that are frictionless and don't make you grow. They just repeat
                            what you're already thinking. I think that actually it is fine if people would be confronted
                            with ideas that are different from their own ideas because this gives design the opportunity
                            to play a role in culture and collective learning and visual literacy. So, what might be
                            interesting is if you want to think about design as a cultural voice, then how can design
                            give context about what it is doing and why it is doing what it does? Just to give
                            transparency about the motives and being transparent about where this is coming from and why
                            it is done. Of course, in commercial design, nobody wants this because they just want to
                            persuade people to do what they want. But, if you would see design as a part of culture or
                            something that is building culture or constructing culture, then this transparency would be
                            definitely something that I would find interesting. Something that maybe I am not the target
                            audience of would become interesting because I would get the chance and the opportunity to
                            learn about a different culture or a different perspective. So, I would be happy to get
                            something that is maybe done for an audience in Latin America because it would give me a
                            chance to learn about their visual codes and cultural codes."

                        <p><strong>I was thinking of different sciences and I've been reading this book, <a
                                    href="https://valiz.nl/en/publications/let-s-become-fungal" target="_blank"
                                    class="pulsating-link">Let's Become Fungal</a>.It's basically mycelial teachings by
                                Yasmine Ostendorf and it has documentation of indigenous people and women identifying
                                people
                                from Latin America, and their knowledge. When I was reading about the mycelial networks
                                in
                                the book, it made me think about your approach towards systems as well. It was very
                                interesting for me to think that, could you imagine mycelial or rhizomatic systems as
                                flexible visual systems or any unconventional structures like fluid or fractal-based
                                systems?</strong>
                            <br><br>
                            "Yeah, that's very interesting. it's nice. I like that you have this in my writings. But I
                            don't know if I was aware of this when I wrote the book. I'm more and more aware of this as
                            well of the way how I think about systems now, that they're hard to plan. So they have to
                            organically grow and emerge. I definitely think that there's a relationship between this
                            kind of fungal neural networks of forests and systems. I think mainly the distinctions that
                            I would make is that we have to be very conscious about the difference between artificial
                            and living systems. We as people, we are living systems and we might not even see everything
                            that connects us and how we are connected. But when we're designing a system that is most of
                            the times an artificial system. So we might be more in the planning state and not that much
                            in the emergence state. I came to this realization that very artificial systems are more
                            likely to break because they don't correspond to the reality of an organization. For
                            example, like the typical thing that a planned system is not going to be used by the people
                            because it doesn't correspond to their way of working. This is something that I came to
                            realize that when we design systems, they're intended to be flexible but sometimes they're
                            not, because it's an artificial system and it's something that we planned . We might not
                            have seen everything that we need to apply this system or integrate and implement it in the
                            organization that has to use it."
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Yeah, it makes me think of letting go of control at some point in systems.</strong>
                            <br><br>
                            "Yeah, that's interesting. It's because when you're designing, you're trying to control a
                            situation that you might not be able to foresee because you're designing for something that
                            is going to happen in the future. You're designing something for people that are not with
                            you when you design it. So how can you design a system that can flexibly change as well in
                            the future and be more emergent and evolutive in the process? From personal experience I
                            think, and it's not just me who says this, like Interbrand talks about the brand cycle. I
                            think it's a problem that we as designers get commissioned and then we leave the project.
                            Actually, we should be part of the project and be able to be there when it's changing and
                            adapt. I think that's one of the critical problems."
                            <br><br>
                           <strong> I wonder if a flexible visual system that represents an organization changes based on how
                            the organization is evolving. For example, if the organization introduces new policies to be
                            inclusive, the FVS mirrors that transformation and I feel like you're talking about
                            something similar.</strong>
                            <br><br>
                            "Exactly. If we talk about flexible systems as identity systems, I think then we have to
                            talk as well about different functions of it, because one is the identification. From the
                            outside, what is this organization identified for or recognized by? The other thing is,
                            internally. Do we have a purpose as an organization that we all can stand behind? This can
                            be very abstract, something in the future. But then you have the actual day-to-day work, and
                            in the book that I have written <a href="https://flexiblevisualsystems.info/"
                                target="_blank" class="pulsating-link">Flexible Visual Systems</a>, this circle is about
                            corporate action, corporate
                            image. It's the day-to-day communication. Does this represent as well what we want to
                            achieve as an organization? So, I think it's a continuous interaction in between these
                            points. What is our identity? What do we want to achieve long term? What's our purpose? How
                            are we seen from the outside and how we're actually behaving and communicating is
                            reflected?"

                            in Germany. We do a lot of topic(??) mappings, and we always come to the point where the
                            maps become too complex for an outsider. So the insider who did the map still understands or
                            knows how to navigate through the map. But there always comes the phase where we have to use
                            our Designer's Head and then work with hierarchies and visual variables and make the
                            different typologies of information accessible through design. This is also a part of the
                            work that I'm doing for the not-for-profit organization Dark Matter Labs. We should never
                            reduce complexity because it gives us a more real model. It's like what Dana Meadows

                            to get a more real perspective on reality, and then we can make this more accessible through
                            design."

                                Rebecca Elson is that she was a scientist, but her work often blends data with emotional
                                resonance. She used to write poetry and describe complex mysteries of the scientific
                                concepts. In flexible visual systems, I was thinking, how do you balance the logical,
                                data-driven aspects of design with the emotional or experiential impact? Can it be both
                                mathematically precise and emotionally engaging?</strong>
                            <br><br>
                            "That's a very deep question. I think the easiest way for me to answer this is to answer as
                            a human. I think we can feel math or physics because we all are born on this planet. We
                            experience the same physical laws and are able to communicate with each other. In my
                            thinking or in my designing, I don't think much about math or physical laws. I'm trying to
                            intuitively feel what I'm doing there because math and physics are embedded already in this
                            feeling. I think that this kind of intuitive way of working and thinking comes closest to
                            how the user of the system will perceive the identity as well. So it's for me, it's a very
                            intuitive process. What maybe is a little bit more mathematical is later, the description of
                            the system when you are making a design manual, and you try to be very clear about the
                            rules. When I'm designing, I don't really think about the rules. Then, in retrospect, I have
                            to think, why did I do this? So, how can you put this into a phrase or a rule so that
                            someone else understands what you were doing there and can reproduce it in a similar way? I
                            think this is when the objectivity of math comes more into play. That's why I'm very careful
                            about automation of design processes because at the end, it's still communication by or in
                            between humans and if it feels wrong, then it's probably wrong. I think you have to access
                            this, your gut feeling about it, to make a decision if something works or if it doesn't
                            work."

                            "Yeah, I think it definitely could help, but I think it shouldn't be the systems that I
                            propose, because I think every culture has it's own visual systems. Just look at patterns,
                            you find patterns everywhere over the world in every century. You can go back and you can
                            travel wherever you want to. I wouldn't like this kind of democratization that happens
                            through digital tools because they just make everything look the same. I would be more happy
                            if flexible visual systems would be seen as an approach, and then each person could access
                            their own systems. I'm trying to just give not even a template, but a methodology of how you
                            could work and think. But then you should access your own creativity and your own systems
                            because otherwise, we will have this big mish-mash that's a bit boring. I like that people
                            bring in their own systemic thinking."

                                <p><strong>I have an undergrad in Textile design before I studying Graphic design.
                                        I've grown up with patterns and motifs around me. While reading the flexible
                                        visual systems, there's this part of me whenever I try to work with visual
                                        culture of India, as I'm from India, I keep thinking about the preservation of
                                        indigenous crafts and motifs. I always get in this area where I cannot decide,
                                        if I apply digital systems or digital thinking which can help with those
                                        preservation or if that's not the way to go. I was wondering, what do you think
                                        about that and preservation of such visual traditions using digital
                                        systems?</strong>

                                    "I think for me it's the most interesting thing to do. We had this experience when
                                    we did a project with <a href="https://new.twopoints.net/" target="_blank"
                                        class="pulsating-link">Two Points</a> for Jordania, and Lupi traveled to Jordan
                                    and Aman.
                                    She saw everywhere that there were food trucks with a flexible system on them. It
                                    was always a pattern, similar colors and similar grids, but always different kinds
                                    of patterns. We used this then as an identity for architects from Aman. But we also
                                    experienced that they were telling us, the cool new stuff is like the commercial
                                    language of the States, which we find quite boring, and we like more the traditional
                                    patterns. But they say they are perceived as old-fashioned and maybe too
                                    traditional. So, I understand that you don't want to be conservative about it, but
                                    it would be nice if it could be a fresh new young interpretation of what is there,
                                    because otherwise, we end up with everything looking like it's in design templates."

                                                made thousands of systems out of it. I was wondering that seems very
                                                interesting - you're giving a different life to an existing motif

                                            wouldn't mind if someone is discovering something from a different culture.
                                            It's nice to have a little bit more diversity in the visual systems. I don't
                                            care if someone from the States would look at something French or something
                                            German or... I think it would be sad if all this cultural richness would be
                                            lost. So I don't care who does it, but it would be nice if people would do
                                            what she did, like picking this up and seeing how this could be transported

                                                        this thought, I was thinking ornamentation means different

                                                        So, for you, how do you define structure and ornamentation? Do
                                                        you think both terms can work together in a system? If we are

                                                        ornamentation might be different than any other culture. How do
                                                        I make sure I'm not appropriating it?</strong>

                                                    "Yeah, see, this is the thing that maybe sounds a bit provocative,
                                                    but I actually don't care. Of course, I care if a big fashion
                                                    company just steals something from people and then they make a lot
                                                    of money with something that they did not create or invent. Of
                                                    course, I'm bothered by this. But I'm also bothered by big AI
                                                    companies just stealing the work of illustrators and designers and
                                                    making money off it. This is the same kind of botheredness I have
                                                    about it. But when you look at the design history of Germany, then I
                                                    find it ridiculous to talk about Swiss design or German design or
                                                    Russian design, because we wouldn't have had the Bauhaus if there
                                                    wouldn't have been the Russian constructivist. So is Bauhaus Russian
                                                    or is it German? Then you wouldn't have the Swiss design. If the
                                                    German designers and artists wouldn't have to flee Nazi Germany and
                                                    go to Switzerland or you wouldn't have the kind of Paul Rand and
                                                    Saul Bass designers if they wouldn't have opened up Bauhaus in
                                                    schools in America. So if you just go back long enough, then you see
                                                    that it's all a big mix of things. I think it's a bit sad to just
                                                    pin it down to different people or pin it down to different
                                                    countries because borders, they're just inventions, they actually
                                                    don't exist. Also the stockhold(??) about people doesn't exist. I
                                                    think the Bauhaus just existed, not because they're geniuses. It's
                                                    like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77mbz2HbY5Y"
                                                        target="_blank" class="pulsating-link">Brian Eno</a>, he's
                                                    talking about the Scenius that makes geniuses.
                                                    So the Bauhaus wouldn't have been in the middle of the Netherlands
                                                    where they had the De Stijl and the Russians. Then a knowledge-flow
                                                    wouldn't have existed. I think the knowledge flow is much more
                                                    important than the actual people that we are looking at. The same
                                                    about the Renaissance, if there wouldn't have been the Silk Road,
                                                    then they wouldn't have gotten all this knowledge from math, from
                                                    the Arabs and the knowledge from the Orient. There was the Italian
                                                    Renaissance. It sounds for me absurd because they were just in at
                                                    the right time, at the right place, where all the knowledge went
                                                    through. It might sound a little bit provocative, but this culture
                                                    appropriation thing is a bit weird to me. I think the stock hold
                                                    (??) is a bit weird to me. I hope you understand what I'm trying to
                                                    say."
